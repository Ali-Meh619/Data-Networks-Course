# Data Networks Course(Graduate)

This is the repository for my solutions to the Data Networks course's coumputer and theoritical assignments at Sharif University of Technology. This course was taught by Prof. Pakravan at the Department of Electrical Engineering.

**Assignment 1:** Introduction to Data Networks and Physical Layer

**Assignment 2:** Simulating Data Link Protocols such as Stop and Wait, Go Back-N and Selective Repeat

**Assignment 3:** Simulation of MAC Sublayer Protocols such as ALOHA, P-Persistance Via NS3

**Assignment 4:** Simulation of Dijkstra Routing Algorithm Via NS3 and its Implemention Via Python 

**Final Project:**
- Implementation of LTE Standards for a Simple Call Service in a 4G Network Via Socket Programming
